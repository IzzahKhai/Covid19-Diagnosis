# Covid19-Diagnosis

This project develops a model that can diagnose covid-19 based on chest x-ray that have been separated into train and test images dataset. The model that will be used to train and test the dataset is by using a deep learning algorithm that is Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The result produced then will be measured by evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and f1-score to evaluate whether it manages to predict the result based on the test dataset. Simple application to test the model, has been created with simple function upload and predicts the image that has been uploaded.
